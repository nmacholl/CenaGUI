![Preview of CenaGUI.](http://i.imgur.com/XpucYd9.png)

CenaGUI serves as a simple example of how to create Matlab GUIs without using any assistant tools such as GUIDE.
The general approach to CenaGUI is to break the interface components into classes and have each class manage those component's activity. Each class is then responsible for managing it own UI controls and logic.

CenaGUI was written in Matlab 9.1.0.441655 (R2016b).
